      <p>
        DialRes-LREC26 focuses on the challenges and opportunities in dialectal NLP 
        from a resource perspective; it seeks to bring together researchers from 
        linguistics, computational linguistics, digital humanities, and related areas 
        to share work on the creation, documentation, and exploitation of dialectal 
        resources.
      </p>

      <h3>Author Support</h3>
      <p>The workshop will offer individual tutoring and mentoring upon request. Interested authors should contact the organizers at least 10 days before the paper submission deadline at:
         <strong>dialres-lrec26@googlegroups.com</strong>
        This support is addressed especially to early-career researchers and contributors working with dialectal data who have limited or no prior experience in developing NLP-oriented resources.
      </p>

      <h3>Submission Information</h3>
      <p><strong>Instructions for Authors</strong> Submissions are  electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system via the link: 
      <a href="https://softconf.com/lrec2026/DialRes" target="_blank">https://softconf.com/lrec2026/DialRes</a>. They must be <strong>4 to 8 pages long</strong> (excluding references and potential Ethics Statements) and  follow the <strong>LREC stylesheet</strong>, available on the conference website on the Author’s kit page <a href="https://lrec2026.info/authors-kit/" target="_blank">Author’s Kit</a>. 
      All templates are also available from <a href="https://lrec2026.info/calls/second-call-for-papers/" target="_blank">this</a> page. 
      </p>

      <h3>Review Process</h3>
     <p>All submitted abstracts and papers will undergo a <strong>double-blind peer review</strong> process. Submissions will be evaluated anonymously by at least two members of the Program Committee. Authors’ identities will not be disclosed to reviewers during the evaluation. Submissions must therefore be <strong>fully anonymized</strong> and must not include names, affiliations, acknowledgements, or other identifying information, including references to non-anonymized external resources.
       Submissions will be assessed based on their <strong>relevance to the workshop topics, scientific quality, originality, and clarity of presentation.</strong> Accepted contributions will be selected for presentation at the workshop and inclusion in the workshop proceedings, in accordance with LREC workshop policies.
     </p>
      
     <h3>Resubmissions from the LREC Main Conference</h3>
     <p>It will also be possible to submit papers that were <strong>rejected from the LREC 2026 main conference</strong> to DialRes 2026. Such submissions must be revised to fit the scope and format of the workshop and must comply with the same anonymization requirements.
     </p>

      <p><strong>Endorsements</strong> The workshop is endorsed by UniDive COST Action CA21167 and Archimedes Athena R.C.</p>
